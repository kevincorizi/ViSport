## DISCLAIMER

This respository is currently abandoned. It was a short one time adventure, but unfortunately we don't have the time nor the resources to keep it going. We hope it will make a good starting point for anyone interested in similar projects. Feel free to use it as you like!

## About ViSport

We started this project during the Make It Wearable! Hackathon 2016, in Turin. ViSport is proof of concept of a virtual playground mixing motion-based, wearable controls and virtual reality. In our demo, you can play a game of bowling in an immersive environment. To do that you need:

   * Any Google Cardboard compatible device.
   * An Android Wear smartwatch.

Swing your arm gently to adjust your aim, than do a fast swing to toss the bowling ball. 

## Build

Unfortunately we cannot provide a running build of ViSport, as we no longer have the necessary hardware to test it. You can however experiment with it yourself!

#### Lesto Unity Controller

This is the name we gave to our controller app. Build it using Android Studio, then deploy the main and the companion app on your smartphone and smartwatch respectively. Be sure to upgrade to the most recent version of Google Play Services (we lost a significant amount of time due to that, seriously).

#### Unity Project

The game was built using Unity 5.4.2. It should be fine upgrading to a more recent version. Deploy on your Android smartphone, be sure that the Lesto app is running and your smartwatch connected.
